        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          This is a project where I designed the front page of a non-profit
          informational website for desktop and mobile view. Because I enjoy
          baking, my concept is a nonprofit cake baking organization that
          specializes in designing cakes for underprivileged youth, including
          youth in foster care, homeless shelters, and low income housing. I
          focused on designing a website that expresses their passion for
          bringing joy to every child and making them feel special.

          <h5>Target Audience</h5>
          <p>
            My target audience are middle class young teens and adults ranging
            from 13-25 years old. They have a spacious kitchen workspace and
            convenient access to ingredients and gadgets. They are responsible
            and reliable and are confident in their baking and decorating
            skills. They have plenty of free time and enjoy designing cakes to
            make people happy. Some examples are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A middle school or high school student that lives with a
              supportive family and in a suburban area, so it&#39;s convenient
              to shop for ingredients. Their parents have a flexible schedule
              and can help them make deliveries.
            </li>
            <li>
              A young adult, either in college or just starting off in their
              career, has a stable income and a flexible work schedule. They
              have plenty of free time to bake cakes and make deliveries or have
              compassion for underprivileged youth and would like to make a
              donation.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

          <h5>Comparative Analysis</h5>
          <div class="bakersmile-div">
            <div>
              <img src="../images/bakersmile/analysis-1.jpg" alt="analysis" />
              <img src="../images/bakersmile/analysis-2.jpg" alt="analysis" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="../images/bakersmile/analysis-3.jpg" alt="analysis" />
              <img src="../images/bakersmile/analysis-4.jpg" alt="analysis" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            I found these two websites that are also a non-profit organization
            that matches volunteers with underprivileged youths to bake and
            deliver birthday cakes for them. Both sites have selections for you
            to donate or volunteer and sections where you can view their
            creations, chapters, and impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a glance, the website on the left certainly looks more kid
            friendly than the one on the right because of the cute graphics,
            cheerful color scheme, and friendly typeface. It even has a very
            cute branding name: For Goodness Cakes. The website on the right,
            Cake4Kids, is less decorative and more limited in color. It mainly
            uses blue and white, which are colors you usually see for a
            professional website, so that was probably the look they were going
            for. For Goodness Cakes looks more authoritative and trustworthy
            because of how well designed and organized their site is, but if you
            read the content displayed on Cake4Kids, it is very informative and
            knowledgeable. Both sites include their contact information,
            including their address, email, and phone number, which also makes
            them seem more trustworthy. I definitely like the For Goodness Cakes
            website more because it is more inviting. As for Cake4Kids, it has
            great information and knowledge, which boosts their site&#39;s
            credibility, but it is missing that welcoming feeling for users. I
            would conclude that Cake4Kids is a good example in terms of
            information and credibility, but a bad example for the design of the
            site. On the other hand, I think For Goodness Cakes is a great
            example for the website&#39;s design, but it could use a little more
            proof of credibility and knowledge like Cake4Kids.

          <h5>First Draft</h5>
          <img src="../images/bakersmile/first-draft-1.jpg" alt="first draft" />
          <img src="../images/bakersmile/first-draft-2.jpg" alt="first draft" />
          <img src="../images/bakersmile/first-draft-3.jpg" alt="first draft" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Site feels a bit text heavy maybe because I haven&#39;t added all
              of the images yet or the “How you can help” part
            </li>
            <li>
              The site feels targeted towards mothers of young children,
              especially because of the picture of a young girl with a cake
            </li>
            <li>
              The square pictures and circle graphics is inconsistent, makes the
              hierarchy confusing
            </li>
            <li>
              The navigation bar text is incredibly small and nearly invisible
              compared to the body text in the site &#8212; seems like it is one
              of the least important parts of the website, if not just a mere
              decoration
            </li>
            <li>
              The big chunks of text in the testimonials of the "how you can
              help" section look like standalone sections. The text has too much
              cognitive load and makes each paragraph seem like its own section.
              The headers of each section are also not contrasted enough - on
              first glance it is difficult to see which section ends where based
              on your typography choices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Probably don&#39;t need so much text because people won&#39;t read
              all of it. One quick sentence and larger font and a "Learn more"
              button can function better to give some information about the
              topic on the home page and remove the cognitive load.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider making the text hierarchy stronger by using bold text
              more frequently
            </li>
            <li>
              The footer definitely needs a lot more info: the address, phone
              number, social media icons, etc. are some places to start
            </li>
            <li>
              More color contrast is needed all over the website. The pastels
              are nice, but the white text over them makes things really hard to
              read.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the text a dark grey instead of black, because it feels like
              there is a slight disconnection between the very light pastel
              colors with the grey text and the black text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maybe stick to one font or 2 max. Could pick a font for the logo
              that would fit with the font from the website more
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bakersmile">

            alt="second draft"
          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Space out the sections more like between "What we do" and "Cake
              gallery" so they look like they are more separated
            </li>
            <li>
              The target audience is very clear; call to action is also very
              clear - has multiple buttons all up and down the page asking for
              volunteers. It is not overshadowed at all by the donation buttons
            </li>
            <li>
              From a hierarchy standpoint, the drop down arrows under "What We
              Do" blend in with the rest of the text - contrasting them with the
              text by adding color will help solidify the hierarchy
            </li>
            <li>
              There is one blue heading - this is mostly a "mission statement"
              of sorts rather than a heading but be aware that eyes travel a lot
              to that blue at the top of the page
            </li>
            <li>
              If not adding anything else to the footer, consider making it
              smaller as it calls a lot of attention
            </li>
            <li>
              There can be more differentiation between the see more button and
              get involved buttons (to show which one&#39;s more important,
              maybe adding an arrow to show that the gallery is expandable?)
            </li>
            <li>
              Recommend adding more color in the middle sections &#8212; mostly
              see it in the beginning and end
            </li>
            <li>
              Another would section would be like upcoming events that are
              happening that kids can join or fundraisers to make it more
              interesting

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          I designed this non-profit baking organization website for desktop and
          mobile view in Figma. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the graphics
          and Photoshop to crop the background of images. I also used photos of
          my own cakes I&#39;ve created. I am proud of how cohesive the images
          are with my designs and color choices and how friendly and welcoming
          the overall website appears for my target audience.
