          This is a snowboarding app that I helped my student develop in
          FlutterFlow when I was working as a coding instructor. The goal was to
          create an app for users interested in snowboarding to learn new and
          useful tips, purchase good quality and affordable gear, book resorts,
          and stay up to date on snowboarding current events.

        <p>
          These are the wireframes my student proposed to me. Given the time
          constraint on this project, we used the templates provided in
          FlutterFlow to design similar interfaces that my student had in mind.

        <h4>Development</h4>
        <div>
          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>
            This app is called Woohoo. It was developed in FlutterFlow and uses
            Google Firebase to collect and stream data. It is an app that is
            published on
            <a
              href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycompany.snow&hl=en_US&gl=US"
              target="_blank"
              >Google Play</a
            >
            and the
            <a
              href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lichengs-woohoo/id6467347394"
              target="_blank"
              >App Store</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5>Challenges</h5>
          <img
            src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-1.jpg"
            alt="Firstore database"
          />
          <p>
            One of the challenges about this project was figuring out how to
            organize the Firestore database. Since we were using the ListView
            widget, we created a collection for every different category and
            added a document for each item. Each document has the same fields,
            but different information. We found this method to be the most
            efficient, since the ListView widget streams each document&#39;s
            content within a collection based on the same fields.
          </p>
          <div class="snowboarding-imgs">
            <img
              src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-2.jpg"
              alt="edit profile interface"
              id="edit-profile"
            />
            <img
              src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-3.jpg"
              alt="Flutterflow code"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Another challenge was implementing the functionality for the edit
            profile screen. This was an interface that I helped my student
            design from scratch. I helped figure out how to allow the user to
            upload a new profile picture, change their information, save their
            changes to FireStore, and display the new changes on their current
            profile. Without permanently saving a user&#39;s uploaded photo in
            the database yet, in case they cancel their changes, I had my
            student create an app state, so that the image is saved in a
            variable and will only update to FireStore if the user saves their
            changes.
          </p>
          <div class="snowboarding-imgs">
            <img
              src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-4.jpg"
              alt="interface"
            />
            <img
              src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-5.jpg"
              alt="interface"
            />
            <img
              src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-6.jpg"
              alt="interface"
            />
          </div>
          <img
            src="../images/snowboarding/challenges-7.jpg"
            alt="Flutterflow code"
          />
          <p>
            For the home page, my student wanted to display different categories
            of information for the users: general information about
            snowboarding, different snowboarding shapes, and some useful tips.
            To keep this design clean and simple, we used the PageView widget,
            so that the user can slide through the images. Since there were two
            other categories, I had my student create two buttons beneath that
            would change the content of the PageView images when clicked. My
            student also wanted the images to revert back to the general
            information if the user clicked that same button twice. In order to
            accomplish all of these goals, I had him create an app state called
            &#39;buttonname&#39;, which would update when a button is clicked.
            We wrote an if/else statement that would either update to the button
            name or null. Then, for the PageView widget, we wrote if/else
            if/else statements that would display the corresponding images based
            on the updated app state.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were other minor challenges I had when working on this project
            with my student because it was my first time working with
            FlutterFlow, so it took me some time to figure out how to use many
            of the features such as using simple search to implement the
            functionality of the search video bar and using form widgets to
            allow users to filter the resorts data generated from FireStore.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          Overall, I learned so much about how to use the available features in
          FlutterFlow to build such a fun app. I am proud of how this project
          turned out and it was interesting to learn how to implement the
          functionality of an interface without actually coding.
