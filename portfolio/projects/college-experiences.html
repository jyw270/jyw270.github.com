        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          This is a project where the prompt was to tell a personal narrative
          about my own growth, learning or mental/physical health through the
          development of an interactive project using different JavaScript
          libraries. I focused my website on welcoming users to reflect on their
          college experience by using the Conversational Form library for users
          to submit their input and the Swiper library to carousel the
          individual card submission on the website. I also used the Back4App
          database to perform CRUD actions on each card.
        </p>

        <h4>User Interface</h4>

          <h5>Brainstorming</h5>
          <img
            src="../images/college-experiences/brainstorming.jpg"
            alt="brainstorming sketches"
          />
          <p>
            After researching the available JS libraries, I decided to focus on
            Slick, Conversational Form, and ApexCharts. My idea was to use the
            Conversational Form library to have the users fill out a form and
            intake information about their college experience. Then, use Slick
            to have each card carousel and allow users to perform CRUD actions
            on their card. I also planned to use ApexCharts to display a summary
            of statistical data for visitors to see.

          <h5>Design Comp</h5>
          <img
            src="../images/college-experiences/design-comp-1.jpg"
            alt="design comp"
          />
          <img

          <p>
            This was my first interface I designed. I wanted to display each
            user&#39;s input in a card to resemble a certificate and I wanted to
            display the statistics and summary of their goals and
            accomplishments below. However, the pastel colors I chose didn&#39;t
            seem to reflect the college experience topic and the entire design
            felt too divided. I also didn&#39;t really have any purpose for the
            charts and I felt like they were adding too much unnecessary detail
            to the page.
          </p>
          <div class="college-exps">
            <img
              src="../images/college-experiences/design-comp-3.jpg"
              alt="design comp"
            />
            <img
              src="../images/college-experiences/design-comp-4.jpg"
              alt="design comp"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            I improved my design by removing the charts, adding a blue outline
            on the cards to make them look more like certificates, and changing
            the color theme to a more calming and inviting place for reflection.
            I also designed the interface to view a person&#39;s card and read
            about their college experience. My idea was to display their name,
            college year, a summary of their experience, how they have grown,
            and their overall experience using a smiley face or sad face.
          </p>
          <div class="college-exps">
            <img
              src="../images/college-experiences/design-comp-5.jpg"
              alt="design comp"
            />
            <img

              alt="design comp"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            I still felt like the color theme wasn&#39;t right, it felt too
            muted. So after doing more research and getting inspiration, I
            removed most of the blue and replaced it with gray and white colors,
            which made the design simple and clean, yet professional and
            welcoming for users. I also decided to display the conversational
            form as an overlay instead when the &#39;share your experience&#39;
            button is clicked because making the page scrollable didn&#39;t seem
            fitting.

            This webpage was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses
            the Conversational Form and Swiper JS libraries as well as the
            Back4App database. It is specifically designed at a 1366 x 768
            viewport as that is the current most popular website dimension.

          <h5>Challenges</h5>
          <p>
            When working on this project, I mainly struggled with learning how
            to use the Conversational Form library because it had some
            limitations or faulty features that I wasn&#39;t sure how to work
            around. And because it isn&#39;t a very well known library, I
            wasn&#39;t able to find much discussion about how to set certain
            things with it on the Web.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5>What Can Be Improved</h5>
          <p>
            Given the time constraint on this assignment, I spent most of my
            time focusing on getting all three tools: two libraries and the
            database to cooperate well. If I had more time, I would test my
            project to make sure there are no faulty errors, especially on the
            user end because I feel like my project has some areas that I
            wasn&#39;t aware of going wrong.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          Overall, working on this project has allowed me to understand how to
          use JavaScript libraries to build websites and it has expanded my
          limitations of only using vanilla JavaScript. Using the Back4App
          database has also given me the opportunity to learn how databases are
          useful and practice performing some of the CRUD actions.
