                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>I will be updating my Every Picture project by implementing a 360 rotation on the display 
                    stand and providing my users with more options to interact with the keychains and their 
                    description pictures.

                <p>This beautiful website, The Open Garden is designed by Weleda. It is full of lovely flowers 
                    and nature and the bird chirping sound makes it so much more alive and relaxing. I can 
                    interact with the site by clicking and dragging to view the garden in 360º and see the 
                    little animations at different areas. There are also little pop up icons that I can hover 
                    and click on to learn about it’s story. The way I can interact with the site is 
                    straightforward in that I don’t need to read or follow any instructions. There are also 
                    other links in the navigation menu, where I can learn more about the different types of 
                    flowers and even take a fun little quiz. But because those links weren’t descriptive enough, 
                    I thought they were just links to text-like information and not more interactions for the 
                    user so, I think that could be something to improve for a user’s experience.

                <p>This pastry website is a modern and innovative 3D design that displays different kinds of treats. 
                    The website automatically scrolls to the next displayed treat if a user is not interacting with 
                    it, but the user is always allowed to disrupt the animation and take control of the scrolling. 
                    The images of each treat is also animated and infinitely rotating in 360, which makes the site 
                    look more exciting. The smooth animation from one display to the next is also working really well 
                    and is appealing for a user. What’s not so obvious is the clickable diamond outline that shows up 
                    besides each displayed treat. It takes you to a more detailed page about the treat, but the link 
                    wasn’t obvious enough to me and I discovered it after I explored the links in the hamburger menu bar.

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>Similar to the pastry rotations and the interactive garden rotation, my goal is to implement an 
                    interactive 360 rotation for my display stand. The user will be able to rotate the stand and pause 
                    anytime to hover and click on a keychain that interests them. Like the Open Garden, once they click 
                    on a keychain, it will display more details and provide a story about it. I also plan on making the 
                    keychains on the stand a little more interactive for my users by maybe having the keychain they hover 
                    over pop out and when they click on it, the story will display. Like the pastry website, I plan on 
                    making my pictures automatically display it’s slideshow, but will allow users to disrupt and click 
                    through the photos themselves. Some things that will be different from my design idea, is that I don’t 
                    think I will have scrolling and different links to another interactive piece.

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>Because I incidentally have a hot pink color showing up along the edges of my display stand, I am matching 
                    the website's color scheme to it, so that the whole webpage can look unified. I will be using bright 
                    magenta with light black and white, so my site would be legible with the contrast in colors. I plan to 
                    achieve a minimal design look because there is already so much detail on the display stand, so adding too 
                    many things may make my page look cluttered. I will also be using a rounded, circular-looking typeface to 
                    soften the neon appearance of my page. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>The interactive pieces in my project will include click and drag for the rotation of the display stand, hover 
                    for each keychain on it, and click to view the story and explore the associating pictures. When the user 
                    hovers over a keychain on the stand, that keychain will pop out a little and the cursor will change to a 
                    pointer, so the user knows that the keychain is clickable. For the set of pictures for each keychain, the 
                    user will get to use previous and next arrow buttons that will show up when they hover over the displayed 
                    picture. And when they hover out of it, the pictures will continue its crossfade slideshow.

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal is to get the 360 rotation stand to work properly because I think it would be the funnest part for the 
                    user to interact with. I want to share my memories from each of my unique keychains, so I feel like the 
                    interactive stand and slideshow pictures will really allow users to step into my position and feel as if they 
                    were experiencing these memories, too.
