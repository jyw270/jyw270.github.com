                <h2>User #1: Ama Dadzie</h2>

                </figure>
                <p>When Ama was interacting with the display stand, I noticed that she was having a hard time rotating
                    it with click and drag. It wasn't rotating smoothly at first, but as she played with it some more
                    it started working properly. She was surprised when the arrow buttons appeared because she didn't 
                    know it was there, but after she read the instructions, it was clear to her. After her experience, 
                    she felt that the stand was rotating too fast per drag and she noticed that the 'click and drag' 
                    text was cut off. She thought the font and color were legible and nothing else needed to be 
                    improved or changed.

                </figure>
                <p>Alexandria also seemed to be having a hard time rotating the stand at first. She thought that the 
                    rotation speed per drag was good and she noticed the keychain stand first when she came on the page. 
                    She noticed the welcome statement and instructions and she also thinks the font size and color 
                    scheme is working well. She felt that the slideshow images were fading in a little too fast. She did 
                    not have any interactive confusions, but she could not see the 'click and drag’ text, along with the 
                    email and validator text because she didn’t have the option to scroll down the page.

                <h2>User #3: Rouxi Peng</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/user3.jpg" alt="user 3 interaction">
                    <figcaption>Rouxi's interaction</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Rouxi was also experiencing difficulty with rotating the stand at first. She first noticed the 
                    crossfading slideshow and she thinks the fading speed is good because she can see the details in time.
                    The font and color were easy to read and she suggested that I can highlight or bold the key words in 
                    my instructions if I want it to stand out more. She also thought that I should make the 'click and 
                    drag' text more obvious and have the user click on a keychain on the stand because the hovering forces
                    users to have to avoid hovering other keychains if they want to move their mouse to interact with the 
                    description box. She noticed that the previous and next button weren't working properly and that
                    hovering over a keychain on the backside was instead displaying the keychain on the other side.

                <h2>Update Plan</h2>
                <p>The things that Rouxi noticed were things that I am trying to figure out in my code. I'm not sure why you 
                    have to double click on the buttons sometimes and I'm not sure why the keychain div containers are
                    showing when the stand is not on that side. Since all three of my users were experiencing difficulty with 
                    the click and drag rotation in the beginning, I need to figure out what's going and also make the rotation 
                    per drag slower. Rouxi's feedback for bolding the key words in the instructions was a really good idea and 
                    I plan on updating that. She also suggested that I change the keychain hover to on click, which is also 
                    something I will update because I agree with her reasoning. I also need to change the overflow hidden that 
                    I set on the whole page because some of my users' screens had a shorter height, so they couldn't see the 
                    bottom text on the page.
                </p>
