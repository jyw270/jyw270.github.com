                    <h3><a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a></h3>
                    <p>After reading this article, I started to realize how much detail goes into game design. As a user, I never noticed the placement 
                        of specific buttons, icons, and more options, so this article has made me rethink my experiences with games. I agree that when 
                        a pop up appears, if there’s an x button, I will automatically close it without reading the content. So, it’s helpful to learn 
                        and realize that we should use other methods rather than the x button as a game designer. Some other helpful tips are to 
                        consider what is comfortable to reach on the screen, how to arrange user choices for pop-ups, and making prizes significant 
                        for watching a rewarded video. I also click the watch video option to get free prizes, sometimes I know what I’m getting and 
                        other times it’s randomized, but I agree that if it weren’t a helpful prize, I would not watch the video. I also agree that 
                        the rate us dialogs can get pretty annoying when it keeps popping up again and again, so it’s helpful to learn when it is the 
                        right time to display it for the user.</p>

                    <h3>Every Picture - Visual Thinking Analysis: Part 1</h3>
                    <p>This is an image of two keychains I assembled as a surprise gift for my friend and I in celebration of our decade long friendship. 
                        The keychains are placed side by side, which highlights the meaning behind them – best friends that are close. The shiny metal 
                        colors make this image look very bright and lively and it attracts the reader to the image. The letters are our initials and the 
                        heart locket contains a photo of us. The sentence on the larger circle shows what these keychains are for and the different 
                        colored jewel on each one, represents a hint of the differences in our personalities. This relates to the topic of my collection 
                        because I am taking specific keychains that hold a special memory or that I find very unique and cute and presenting what they 
                        mean to me and why I value them. The keychains in the image are special to me because I customized them myself and it will be 
                        like a souvenir of my 10 years of friendship. My keychain collection is meant to represent memorable happenings in my life and 
                        express my personality and likings. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Part 2</h3>
                    <p>This image contains a collection of letters, invitations, cards, and notes that seem to hold a significant piece of memory. Each 
                        paper seems to tell a story about an unforgettable happening/event that Peter can always look back at. They seem like special notes 
                        and events that he enjoys reading or looking at again and again. Some interesting aspects of this photo are the handwritten text 
                        because it makes the image look very personal and specific to him and the random layout of the papers makes them look like something 
                        that has been kept for a long time. The colorful notes give the image a pop of color against the black background and white letters 
                        and it makes the memories look memorable, yet alive. The most obvious aspect of this image is that these papers are writings or 
                        invitations that Peter has received from people and really cherishes. The most mysterious aspect is what the content or story is 
                        within each of these papers and who or where they were from.</p>

                        20 Inspirational Examples of Interactive Maps and Street View Experiences in Web Design</a></h3>
                    <p>I’ve always found the idea of being able to navigate a map in perspective view very intriguing. It’s such a fun experience and the 
                        instructions are pretty intuitive. There is consistency with each different map, such as the click and drag method, which makes 
                        it very user friendly. I also think it’s very fun to see the map slowly expand and change as you drag to different places. Being 
                        able to zoom in and get a closer look to see even more details of interior space is super exciting and satisfies my curiosity. 
                        The change in different colors and materials also makes the experience very engaging and keeps the user entertained. I love how 
                        you can change the perspective of how you’re viewing the map and I also learned that there are many customizable properties and 
                        elements that you can use to enhance your experience, which is really cool!

                    <p> Modals are a really cool feature to implement on a webpage, but it’s not always necessary. Sometimes when modals pop 
                        up randomly, I immediately close it without reading it. I agree that this startles the user and that using modals at 
                        the right moment is very important. I learned that they can be considered for use when you want to get information 
                        from the user, provide additional information not directly related to the parent page, or grab the user’s attention. 
                        I also learned that it’s important to provide an escape key for users to exit the modals for convenience. I agree 
                        that it is very helpful to match the modal’s title with the button label that the user clicks on because it reminds 
                        them what they were working on since the pop up interrupts the user flow. In conclusion, these tips are useful for 
                        helping me understand when it is best to use modals.

                    <h3><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices For Form Design</a></h3>
                    <p> As I was reading this article, I couldn't agree more with the key factors mentioned that drive users away from 
                        completing a form. When complex questions are asked at the beginning, when there is no page indicator, or 
                        when I have to fill out private information, I tend to exit the form. When it comes to personal information, 
                        I think it's also important to present credibility on the form to assure them that it is safe to fill out. The 
                        best practices for form design seem like obvious considerations a designer would make, but I believe that 
                        without reading this article, I would've never thought of some of these tips. So these serve as a reminder for 
                        me to consider problems users face and imagine how they would want it to be improved. I find 
                        <b><a href="https://www.hollisterco.com/shop/us">Hollister’s</a></b> sign in/create account form very user friendly 
                        because even though the labels are in the text box, they will appear outside of it when the user clicks on the 
                        box. They also have a helpful eye icon to view your password and provide a little note in creating an acceptable 
                        password for new members.
