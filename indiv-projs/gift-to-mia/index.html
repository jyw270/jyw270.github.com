          <p>Happy birthday Mia!</p>
          <p>
            I hope you like your gift I made just for you. It has a total of 8
            interactions with 1 hover feature, 1 microphone feature, and 6
            clickable features. I also included a copy of the first journal
            entry I wrote for you below. I hope that whenever you look at this,
            it will remind you of how much you mean to me and that this is
            something I keep in my gratitude journal, something that I read to
            cheer myself up when I’m feeling down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also wanted to get the chance to tell you directly, even though
            I’ve implied it a lot, that you hold a special place in my heart. I
            like that you have a side of you that is just like me. I like that
            you can truly understand my world from my perspective and have made
            the effort to be attuned to it. I like that it's really easy to
            start an off topic conversation with you. I like that you have a
            cute smile. I like that seeing you always makes me happy even though
            I probably don’t show it. And most of all, I like that you are also
            the year of the Dragon, specifically Fall, just like me. It makes me
            feel even more connected to you. It feels like double the luck that
            you're two Dragon generations ahead of me, or maybe even triple
            since you're also a Fall Dragon — or quadruple because we met in the
            Year of the Dragon, 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you Mia — for proving to me that there are people like me who
            can be so emotionally attuned to someone’s feelings and desires and
            that I am worthy of receiving that level of care, too. I hope that
            one day if our paths align we will meet again, even if I’m just
            telling myself that to feel better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, I hope you have a great birthday and I hope if and when you
            revisit your gift every year, you will think of me. Wishing you the
            happiest birthday!
          </p>
          <p>Jenny</p>
