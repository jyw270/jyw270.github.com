    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        My project will be a communal blog site, where users from all around the
        world can share their cultural desserts and recipes, so that people can
        explore and understand the cultural differences in food.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of my project is to allow people to evaluate the cultural
        differences in desserts, explore the different methods of baking, and
        understand and appreciate the uniqueness of each culture&#39;s food.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/">Curious Cuisini√®re</a> is a
        blog site that posts cultural recipes from all around the world. It is
        run by a couple that loves to explore food. For my blog, instead of one
        person posting, I want to allow multiple users to post, so that people
        can also learn how people with a specific cultural background make their
        food. <a href="https://nutsaboutgreens.com/">Nuts About Greens</a> is a
        blog site that posts many healthy and vegan friendly recipes. Users
        could generate certain recipes by category, which is similar to my idea,
        but instead, users will be filtering by culture and continent.

      <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        I am aiming to design a blog site that is minimalistic, neat, and
        welcoming. Because it is a site where any user can post to it, I want to
        keep the interface as simple as possible, so it is not overwhelming or
        hard to navigate. I will be using a grey and white themed color palette
        to set a calming, clean mood for the page and I will be using friendly
        typefaces to incorporate the welcoming idea.

      <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        To simplify to process and avoid users from having to create an account
        or login, I think I will prompt the user to fill out a form if they want
        to share a recipe. I am planning on having a navigation bar at the top
        of the page and checkbox filter options on the left side. The center of
        the page will be a grid layout of posted dessert recipes that people can
        click on.
      </p>

      <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Through this communal blog, I hope that users who share their cultural
        desserts will become confident and proud about their culture. They will
        be able to accomplish this by filling out a form to post to the page. I
        also hope that users who stumble upon this page can not only appreciate
        cultural foods, but also learn and respect the cultural differences from
        around the world. To make the comparisons easier, this blog will only
        allow users to share desserts.
