          During this feedback session, my partner suggested that in addition to
          allowing users to generate recipes by culture, I could also add a
          continent filter, where they can select a recipe from a specific
          continent. He also raised a concern of when there are duplicate recipe
          posts, what would happen? These ideas helped me think of how certain
          continents might not have access to certain ingredients and how I
          would deal with duplicate posts or recipes by different users.

        <p>
          In this feedback session, my partner didn't have much feedback to
          give, which could mean that my improved storyboard was pretty
          thorough. The only concern she had was whether I could broaden the
          types of food to posts, instead of just desserts. This is something
          that I did think of, but my idea for that was slightly more
          complicated. Focusing on just cultural desserts made more sense for me
          because my purpose was for the site to be a place where people can
          compare different cultural food and notice the obvious differences.
