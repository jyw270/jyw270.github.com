      <h2>User &#35;1&#58; Urvi</h2>
      <img src="images/user1.jpg" alt="user 1" />
      <p>
        When Urvi was working on the tasks, I noticed that she never tried to
        continue onto the next page without filling in the input and she always
        clicked on the next button, instead of hiting the enter key. I think she
        didn&#39;t think to hit the enter key because she had to click on the
        input box already, so she was just used to using the mouse. We are
        trying to get the input to focus when the form is displayed and I think
        this way users will be more likely to hit the enter key. Urvi also
        noticed that the database was printing out all of the responses twice in
        the gallery when she tried to fill out the form again. This is an error
        we didn&#39;t notice, so we will definitely fix that.

      <h2>User &#35;2&#58; Penghua</h2>
      <img src="images/user2.jpg" alt="user 2" id="user2" />
      <p>
        Penghua also never used the enter key to move onto the next page and
        didn&#39;t try to continue without filling out the input. So, getting
        the input to focus would make people more likley to use that function. I
        also noticed that the background animation didn&#39;t show up on the
        forms when she tried to fill out the form again from the gallery view. I
        talked to Ama about this issue and she said that was still a work in
        progress and that she just didn&#39;t bring it back yet.

      <h2>User &#35;3&#58; Rachel</h2>
      <img src="images/user3.jpg" alt="user 3" />
      <p>
        I noticed that Rachel hit enter once in the beginning and then after
        that she always clicked on the next button. I asked her if having the
        input in focus would make her more likely to hit the enter key and she
        said not necessarily because the next button was pretty eye catching to
        her. She also suggested that clicking on the title in the gallery view
        should take you back to the welcome page. I thought this was a great
        idea and we will probably enable that function. She also suggested that
        we could add instructions for the mouse interaction we plan to implement
        on the welcome page to let users know that they can interact with the
        animation in the background. Letting the users know that available
        feature is something we forgot to consider, so we will probably add it
        somewhere in our project.
