        This blog site posts cultural recipes from all around the world. The
        purpose of this site is to allow people to explore different cuisines
        and understand the cultural history behind each dish. This is a perfect
        example and reference for me, but instead of one person posting, I want
        to allow multiple users to post, so that people can also learn how
        people with a specific cultural background make their food. Other than
        that, I found this website, so interesting because their are such a wide
        range of food and they are all organized into visually appealing
        categories.

        This blog site posts many healthy and vegan friendly recipes. The
        interface is very clean and neat, making it easy for users to navigate
        around. I like how users could generate certain recipes by category,
        which is similar to my idea, but instead, users will be filtering by
        culture and continent. Overall, I really like the simplicity and
        aesthetic of this site. I find it very inspiring.
