      <h2>Culutural Food Practices</h2>
      <p>
        This book provides information on food practices for 15 different
        cultures. Each chapter talks about a culture&#39;s traditional food,
        dishes, current food practices, special holiday food, and more. Most
        importantly it discusses diabete risk factors and culturally appropriate
        counseling recommendations. I think this could be useful for my project
        because not only does it focus on cultural food practices, but it also
        discusses health factors, which could help me expand my perspective on
        how I perceive my topic. Overall, I think the main purpose of this book
        is to act as a health guide for readers, which I found particularly
        interesting.

      <h2>They Eat What? New Year's Food Traditions around the World.</h2>
      <p>
        This website shares the different New Year&#39;s food traditions from
        each culture. It provides an image along with a description of the food
        ingredients and what they represent. This website is useful for my
        project because it shares a similar idea of what I plan on creating,
        except I want to allow users to make posts, so that the site is a little
        more interactive. I feel like the purpose of this reading was to allow
        viewers to learn about other people&#39;s culture and raise awareness
        about the different New Year&#39;s traditions. This is one of my goals
        for the development of my project, so it is definitely a helpful
        reference.

      <h2>Food &#8211; Food and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        This article talks about how people connect to their culture with food.
        It discusses how certain cultural backgrounds eat different food and how
        food can represent a range of things like a culture&#39;s values or
        beliefs, certain practices, and food choices. The author talks about how
        food plays a role in etiquette, specifically table manners and how it
        can form different conversations and food habits. I found this article
        super engaging because it is such a detailed analysis about what food
        can do. I think this will be helpful for my project because it discusses
        food from a different perspective. In summary, I think the author&#39;s
        purpose of viewing food from this perspective was successfully
        delivered.
